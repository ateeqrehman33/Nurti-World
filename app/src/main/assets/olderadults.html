<p><strong><u>Older adults(</u></strong><u>aged older than&nbsp;<strong>55 years)</strong></u></p>
<p>As you age, your nutritional needs begin to change. Most people tend to lose muscle mass as they age, which causes metabolism to slow down. Many people also become less active with age, so in general, you don't need to eat as much food, but nutrient content is still essential.</p>
<h3><strong>Healthy food options</strong></h3>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Protein: Eggs, milk, lean meat, chicken, beans and lentils are excellent protein sources to keep elderly healthy.</li>
<li>Vegetables: Carrots, sweet potato, tomatoes, spinach, broccoli, cabbage, onions and avocados are the healthy vegetables to be included in the diet plan of a 70-year old.</li>
<li>Fruits: Blackberries, strawberries, raspberries, kiwi, peaches, mango, melon and apples should be incorporated in a dietary regimen.</li>
<li>Pulses and Grains: Lentils, chick peas, brown rice and whole wheat products should also be incorporated in a diet plan for 70-year olds.</li>
<li>Nuts and Seeds: Walnuts, cashews, almonds, sunflower seeds, flax seeds and pumpkin seeds are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.onlymyhealth.com/healthy-recipes-1321617221.html">healthy food</a>&nbsp;options for old-age people.</li>
<li>Fish: Salmon, mackerel, sardines, herring, tuna and trout are healthy food options for old age.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><em>Fruits and vegetables</em>are very nutrient rich, and contain many cancer fighting antioxidants. But they also contain fiber, which helps maintain bowel regularity.</li>
<li><em>Water</em>also assists with bowel functions, and it helps your skin stay well hydrated. As you age, your skin has a more difficult time maintaining a moisture balance.</li>
<li>Low-fat dairy products, leafy greens, and canned fish with soft bones that you eat provide needed<em>calcium</em>to help keep your bones strong.</li>
<li><em>Protein&nbsp;</em>can help prevent the loss of muscle mass.</li>
<li><em>Vitamin B12</em>helps in the production of red blood cells, and it also keeps the brain and nervous system healthy. You can find B12 in animal products like meat, fish, and dairy.</li>
<li><em>Avoid processed foods</em>like canned soups, lunchmeats, and frozen meals. These tend to be high in sodium (which can affect blood pressure) and fat.</li>
</ul>
