<p><strong>Pregnant and lactating women</strong></p>
<p>The essential nutrients below will help you and your baby thrive. They're found in fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, beans, dairy products, and lean meats.</p>
<p>You only need about 300 extra calories per day to provide sufficient nutrition for your growing baby. However, gaining some weight is natural during pregnancy, and nursing can help with weight loss after the baby is born.</p>
<h3>Nutrition tips for healthy pregnancy</h3>
<p><strong>Omega-3 fatty acids</strong>&nbsp;are essential for the neurological and early visual development of your baby and for making breast milk after birth. Aim for two weekly servings of cold water fish such as salmon, tuna, sardines, herring, or anchovies. Sardines are widely considered the safest and most sustainable fish to eat, while seaweed is a rich vegetarian source of Omega-3s.</p>
<p><strong>Abstain from alcohol.</strong>&nbsp;No amount is safe for the baby.</p>
<p><strong>Cut down on caffeine</strong>, which has been linked to a higher risk of miscarriage and can interfere with iron absorption.</p>
<p><strong>Eat smaller, more frequent meals</strong>&nbsp;rather than a few large ones. This will help prevent and reduce morning sickness and heartburn.</p>
<p><strong>Be cautious about foods that may be harmful to pregnant women.</strong>&nbsp;These include soft cheeses, sushi, deli meats, raw sprouts, and fish such as albacore tuna, swordfish, tilefish, and king mackerel that contain high levels of mercury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Nutrition tips for healthy breastfeeding</h3>
<p><strong>Keep your caloric consumption a little higher</strong>&nbsp;to help your body maintain a steady milk supply.</p>
<p><strong>Emphasize healthy sources of protein and calcium</strong>, which are higher in demand during lactation. Nursing women need about 20 grams more high-quality protein a day than they did before pregnancy to support milk production.</p>
<p><strong>Take prenatal vitamin supplements</strong>, which are still helpful during breastfeeding, unless your physician tells you otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine.</strong>&nbsp;Just as with the pregnancy guidelines above, refrain from drinking and smoking, and reduce your caffeine intake.</p>
<p>If your baby develops an allergic reaction, you may need to adjust your diet. Common food allergens include cow's milk, eggs, wheat, fish, and citrus. For a cow's milk allergy, you can meet your calcium needs through other high calcium foods, such as kale, broccoli, or sardines.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calcium</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/calcium.html">Calcium</a>&nbsp;helps build&nbsp;<a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/strong-bones.html">strong bones</a>&nbsp;and teeth, and plays an important role in the healthy functioning of the circulatory, muscular, and nervous systems. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should get 1,000 mg of calcium a day.</p>
<p><strong>Healthy sources of calcium include low-fat dairy products, calcium-fortified orange juice and cereals, and spinach.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carbohydrates</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Eating carbohydrates helps provide energy to support the growth and development of a baby and, after delivery, breastfeeding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The best sources of carbs are whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, which also are good sources of fiber.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiber</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/fiber.html">Fiber</a>&nbsp;is a nutrient that can help ease the constipation commonly associated with pregnancy.</p>
<p>Whole grains (like whole-wheat bread, whole-grain cereals, and brown rice) and fruits, vegetables, and legumes (beans, split peas, and lentils) are good sources of fiber.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Folic acid</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/preg-folic-acid.html">Folic acid</a>&nbsp;helps the healthy development of a baby's brain and spinal cord. It's also needed to make red blood cells and white blood cells. Women who get 400 micrograms (0.4 milligrams) of folic acid daily prior to conception and during early pregnancy can reduce the risk that their baby will be born with a neural tube defect (a birth defect involving incomplete development of the brain and spinal cord).</p>
<p>Good sources of folic acid include fortified cereals, leafy green vegetables, citrus fruits, beans, and nuts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Healthy Fats</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Healthy&nbsp;<a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/fat.html">fats</a>&nbsp;(unsaturated fats) are used to fuel a baby's growth and development. They are especially important for the development of the brain and nervous system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Healthy fats are found in olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, avocados, and salmon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iodine</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Iodine helps the body's thyroid gland make hormones that help with growth and brain development. Not getting enough iodine during pregnancy can put a baby at risk for&nbsp;<a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/congenital-hypothyroidism.html">thyroid problems</a>&nbsp;and cognitive delays, some of which can be severe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Pregnant or lactating women should use iodized salt in their cooking and eat foods high in iodine, like seaweed,kombu kelp,wakame,nori,cod(seafish),dairy products,ionized salt,shrimp,tuna,eggs,prunes,lima beans,etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iron</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Eating a diet rich in&nbsp;<a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/iron.html">iron</a>&nbsp;and taking a daily iron supplement while pregnant or breastfeeding helps prevent&nbsp;<a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/ida.html">iron-deficiency anemia</a>. Women who don't get enough iron may feel tired and are at risk for infections.</p>
<p>Good dietary sources of iron include lean meats, fortified cereals, legumes (beans, split peas, and lentils), and leafy green vegetables.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protein</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Protein helps build a baby's muscles, bones, and other tissues, especially in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The recommended protein intake during the second half of pregnancy and while breastfeeding is 71 grams daily.</p>
<p>Healthy sources of protein include lean meat, poultry, fish, beans, peanut butter, eggs, and tofu.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vitamin A</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Vitamin A helps develop a baby's heart, eyes, and immune system. Prenatal vitamins should not contain more than 1,500 micrograms (5,000 IU) of vitamin A and pregnant women should not take vitamin A supplements. Both too little and too much vitamin A can harm a developing fetus.</p>
<p>Good sources of vitamin A include milk, orange fruits and vegetables (such as cantaloupe, carrots, and sweet potatoes), and dark leafy greens.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vitamin B6</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Vitamin B6 helps form a baby's red blood cells; breaks down protein, fat, and carbohydrates; and is needed for normal brain development and function.</p>
<p>Good sources of vitamin B6 include poultry, fish, whole grains, fortified cereals, and bananas.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vitamin B12</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Vitamin B12 plays an important role in the formation of a baby's red blood cells, as well as brain development and function. Vitamin B12 is only found in animal products like meat and eggs, so it's important to speak with your doctor about taking a B12 supplement during your pregnancy and while breastfeeding if you're vegetarian or vegan and don't plan to eat animal products.</p>
<p>Good sources of vitamin B12 include lean meats, poultry, and fish, and fat-free and low-fat milk.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vitamin C</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Vitamin C plays an important role in tissue growth and repair, and in bone and tooth development. Vitamin C also helps the body absorb iron.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good sources of vitamin C include citrus fruits, broccoli, tomatoes, and fortified fruit juices.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vitamin D</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/vitamin-d.html">Vitamin D</a>&nbsp;aids in the body's absorption of calcium for healthy bones and teeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good sources of vitamin D include fortified low-fat or fat-free milk, fortified orange juice, egg yolks, and salmon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One great benefit to being pregnant is that you get to eat more food as your pregnancy advances. Not a tremendous amount of food and it really needs to be healthy food, but you can guiltlessly serve up slightly larger sized portions (especially of those essential fruits and vegetables). In the first trimester, you don't need any additional calories, but you can add in about 300 in the second trimester and 450 in the third (and while nursing). That extra 450 should not come from an extra large order of fries, but should be used to meet your (and the baby's) nutritional needs with fresh fruits and veggies, dairy products, and lean proteins as great choices.In addition to eating high nutrient foods, pregnant and lactating women need to drink plenty of water. Keep a 20-oz water bottle with you throughout the day and refill it as needed. Try to drink 3-4 of these bottles of water per day</p>
