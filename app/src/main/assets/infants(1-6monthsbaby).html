<p><strong>DAILY SERVINGS FOR AN INFANT DIET</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breast milk or infant formula:</strong>&nbsp;Breast milk or infant formula are the only nourishment needed by most healthy babies until they are 4-6 months old. Cow's milk or other dairy products should not be given until at least one year of age. Your baby's kidneys cannot handle the high protein and mineral content well until that age.</li>
<li>0-3 months: 18-32 ounces</li>
<li>4-6 months: 28-40 ounces</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cereals&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>0-3 months: None</li>
<li>4-6 months: 1/4-1/2 cup cereal (mixed)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fruits</strong></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>0-3 months: None</li>
<li>4-6 months: 1/4-1/2 cup, pureed</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Juices</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>0-4 months: None</li>
<li>5-6months: 1/4-1/2 cup</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Water:</strong>&nbsp;Most infants get the water they need from breast milk, formula, or juices. In very hot climates though, they may need 1/2 to 1 cup a day to make up losses.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>0-5 months: Not needed except during very hot weather, or if baby has diarrhea.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>For the first six months of life, medical experts agree that the "gold standard" food of choice is mother's milk. Mother's milk contains the exactly correct proportions of fat, cholesterol, protein, and carbohydrates for baby humans. Mother's milk is not only a perfect nutritional choice; it also provides protection against several diseases because the mother is able to transfer some of her immune system's protection to the baby.</p>
<p>Breastfeeding is not always easy:Some babies, or mothers, have a difficult time adjusting to nursing(breastfeeding). There are also a few medical reasons why nursing may not be the best choice: for example, if the mother has an illness that could be passed to her child through her milk, or if she has to take certain medications that may be harmful to the child.</p>
<p>Most pediatricians recommend that babies eat nothing but mother's milk for the first six months of life.</p>
